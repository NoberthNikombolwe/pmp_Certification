                    <p>A computer is made up of different components that interrelate and work together to achieve a certain assigned task.
                        All of these components have their own specific functions that as we will see later.
                        The components can be categorized as follows below:
                        Computer Hardware
                        Computer Software
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        CPU is one of the most essential component of the computer. 
                        This is the core unit which is said to the centre of all processing actions taking place inside a computer device
                        It is also known as the “Brain of Computer” and no action can be conducted by a device without the execution and permission of the Central Processing Unit.
