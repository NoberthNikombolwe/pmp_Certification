            <h3>Certification Exam</h3>
            <p>Project management professionals need more diverse skills and approaches than ever before. The
                Project Management Professional (PMP) ®  certification exam already changed since 2 January 2021 to
                meet those needs. The exam now is focusing on three new domains:  <br><br>         
                <ol>
                    <li><b>PEOPLE</b>  – emphasizing the skills and activities associated with effectively leading a project team</li>
                    <li><b>PROCESS</b>  – reinforcing the technical aspects of managing a project</li>  
                    <li><b>BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT</b> BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT – highlighting the connection between projects and organization
                        strategy</li>  
                </ol>
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="Project_content">
            <h3>PROJECT PROFESSIONALS ARE EVOLVING</h3>
            <p> Content that spans the value delivery spectrum, including predictive, agile and hybrid approaches, are
                included across the three exam domains. 
                The new PMP exam will require you to have experience in, and answer questions from, three domains:<br>         
                <ol type="A">
                    <li><b>People (42%)</b></li>
                    <li><b>Process (50%)</b> </li>
                    <li><b>Business Environment (8%)</b> </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                Within each of these three domains, there are:
                <ol type="A">
                    <li><b>Tasks</b>  (what project managers need to do) and</li>
                    <li>Enablers (the actions we take to complete the tasks)</li><br>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <p>
                The PMI states that the new PMP examination will give even (50:50) representation to:
                <ol type="A">
                    <li>Predictive project management approaches and</li>
                    <li>Agile or hybrid approaches</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <h3>AGILE IN PMBOK 6TH EDITION</h3>
            <p>
                Many projects are embracing the agile methodology to deliver
                their projects. Hence, PMI has updated
                the PMBOK 6th edition with the relevant agile practices that are needed for each
                knowledge area.
                <br><br>
                Moreover, an appendix containing practices used in adaptive environment is a great change in PMBOK
                6th edition.
                An agile approach to project management is being adopted by more and more organizations to gain a
                competitive advantage and accelerate the delivery and visibility of business values while significantly
                reducing project risks and delays. Project Managers should know this. This Program include agile
                philosophy in the curriculum.

<!-- UPDATES OF PMP TRAINING IN TANZANIA -->
<section>
    <div class="UpdateOfPMp">
        <div class="content">
            <h1>UPDATES OF PMP TRAINING IN TANZANIA</h1>
            <p>
                Since 2011, Tanzania Institute of Project Management (Tenstep Tanzania) has been running a PMP

            <h4>POTENTIAL PROJECT MANAGEMENT POSITIONS IN AN ORGANISATION</h4>
            <p>
                Let’s be frank: Better project management is carried out by better project personnel. A person with Project
                Management Knowledge may play different roles in an organisation. Some of the position a Project
                management practitioner can competently occupy and contribute uniquely in an organisation performance
                include but not limited to:

                <br>
                All these positions require a person with Project Management knowledge and skills, so project management
                practitioners should see themselves as potential for the above mentioned positions. Yes, technical know-how is
                also important in some positions but hard skills by itself are not enough to make somebody efficient and
                effective in delivering project outcome.
